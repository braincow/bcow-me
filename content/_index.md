# Me, myself and I

I am an information technology enthusiast - a someone who still has passion for everything related to computers, hardware, software, networking and the Internet. Architect by heart - I am enthusiastic on design, security and upkeep of information systems. I have worked as a programmer and as an systems engineer, as a client and as an consultant which gives me unique perspective on the industry.

On my spare time I like to play video games, read, draw, watch movies or the night sky and reset my brain with archery or meditation. I also continuously develop my self with new skills of my trade. One day I shall learn how to play the saxophone.

At the moment my fancy is tickled mostly by anything GCP, Rust, Python or Go related things with healthy dose of embedded development and electronics sprinkled in there for flavor.

Currently I work at [Solita](https://www.solita.fi) as Lead Cloud Architect with Google Cloud Platform focus. My opinions are my own.

You can also find me at IRCNet with nick @bcow.

My GPG key is available [here](0x8983856FDCBAFD41.pub): 0x8983856FDCBAFD41.
